            <h1>Payroll</h1>
            <p>When it comes to paying employees, laws and the IRS have made the payroll function a time consuming endeavor for the small business owner.</p>
            <p>Small business owners spend an average of eight hours a month performing payroll functions. That's 12 full days a year that could be spent generating sales, prospecting new business opportunities, improving products or services, or servicing customers.</p>
            <p>We offer payroll solutions that meet your business's needs and enable you to spend time doing what you do best--running your company.</p>
