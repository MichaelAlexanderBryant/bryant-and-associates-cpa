            <h1>Business & CFO Advisory</h1>
            <p>An outsourced business advisor or CFO is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of hiring a financial executive or advisor for your company, you partner with a CPA that can replicate their responsibilities. Business advisor and CFO services typically provide higher-level accounting functions focused on your organization’s financials.</p>
            <p className="list-bold">What we can do for you is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>operational and financial reporting</li>
                <li>cost and cash flow management</li>
                <li>profit analysis</li>
                <li>metric and KPI (Key Performance Indicators) tracking</li>
                <li>business process design</li>
                <li>raising debt or equity capital </li>
                <li>advising and consulting on strategy</li>
                <li>forecasting new business ventures</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consider business advisement services as the company’s strategic brain – the source of ideas and insights that decision-makers use to create projections, forecast disruptions, engineer growth, and plan for the future.</p>
